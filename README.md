## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to work with flexbox in order to make the boxes appear both in a column and grid manner as the given designs stated.
Also learnt how to apply max/min height and width to elements.

```css
section{
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    .box{
    max-width: 278px;
    max-height: 27rem;
    min-height: 24rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I had a little bit problem setting the heights of the boxes so I shall continue learning how to work with min/max height.
